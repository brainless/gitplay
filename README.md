# Welcome to gitplay!

`gitplay` is a desktop app that you can point at a Git repository, and it will show you how the repository unfolds historically.
I like to learn from existing projects, whatever the project or the language it is written in. But in many projects that are worth learning from, there is a long history.
So I struggle to see how the project shaped up in time. What was the first commit of Redis like?
Or at what point did Docker add `compose` - how does `compose` look like at the beginning?

`gitplay` is a project under development, and a very slow pace of development.
This is a learning project that I am using along with my friend to get easy with Rust, the programming language.
I am still new to Rust so this will take some time.

Thanks for checking, please feel free check back in some time. Either the project will grow, or I will give up on this learning effort. I hope it will grow.
