# Welcome to gitplay!

`gitplay` is a desktop app that you can use to learn about the history of any software repository (Git), in an engaging manner.

## Motivation

If you are a software developer or are involved in the development process of your company's software, then you may need to learn about the development history of your project. Perhaps you want to learn about software that is related to your work. Like a web framework or a caching library. A lot of such software is stored in version control system like Git. Git store the history of development, in small chunks called commits. Commits are a like a snapshot that a developer created of the state of the software at a certain point in time. Any software which is/was in active development will have lots of commits (maybe thousands). Commits may have a comment stating what work was done before creating that particular commit. This rich history is what `gitplay` uses and shows in a way similar to watching a video - commit by commit, instead of scene by scene.

## What can I use it for?

If you have a software project that is version controlled in a Git repository, either open source or not, you can simply point `gitplay` to it and see the commit history in chronological manner. For each commit, `gitplay` shows the files as they were in that commit. If you "play" the commits, then you can see how the software developed through time, through the changes in files and folders. You can pin certain folders or files to keep watching their state as they evolved. At any time you can "pause" to browse through the contents of the project.

## Status

`gitplay` is a under active development. It is usable but only allows very simple view of the file structure of your Git repository. Please give it a try and let me know how it feels.
